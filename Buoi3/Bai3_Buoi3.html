                Thank you for our class’ photo you sent me afew days ago. I was so glad to write for you and tell you about my feeling after I receive it.
                That photograph made me remember my old teacher who taught us high school. She is slim with along hair and blue eyes. Do you remember her? Our enghlish teacher, her name is Sara. I can’t forget that days when she played game with us in each class and we sang ‘ Anilmal song’ together. I also remember that She was very sad when our class didn’t do homework and we felt so guilty with her. Then we studied Enghlish hard to fix our mistakes and she was so happy. But now she doesn’t still teach Enghlish in Viet Nam. Ha - our classmates said she came back England with her husband. I hope she would come to Viet nam, I will meet her because I miss her so much. What about you? What do you think about her? Have you ever had the old teacher who made you unforgettable?
